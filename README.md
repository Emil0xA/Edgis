####A Special Interest Group

Edgis provides a platform where infocomm security enthusiasts can meet like-minded people, learn from fellow peers, and contribute to the community. We encourage open source collaborations among our members, and organise workshops and cybersecurity awareness programes.

This repository contains codes I've written for Edgis activities (e.g. talks, tutorials, labs, etc.).
